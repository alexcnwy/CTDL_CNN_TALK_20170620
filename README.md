# Convolutional Neural Networks For Image Classification 
# Cape Town Deep Learning Meet-up Presentation 
# 20 June 2017

```


The notebook covers how to:
* Use a pre-trained model (VGG16) to predict imagenet classes for new images
* How to fine-tune a pre-trained model on another dataset to predict new clases
* How to get CNN activations to use as numerical representations of images
* Using numerical representations of images to find similar images for an input image

## Getting Started

cd to the directory and run
```
jupyter notebook
```

### Prerequisites

```
keras, theano, pandas, numpy, etc (conda distribution should include all pre-requisites, otherwise pip install any missing packages)
```

### Installing

```
Install the Anaconda python distribution available here: https://www.continuum.io/Downloads
```
